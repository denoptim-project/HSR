# 6D Molecular Similarity

This directory contains the files and folder created during the development of a 6D molecular similarity measure and it ought to become the package to import when willing to use such similarity.

# Folder structure

Source: conatins the actual code of the similarity

Tests: Unit tests

Trials: Collect miscellaneous scripts, e.g., `example.py` illustrates the use of the similarity and its functions.
There are two visualization script for the 3D and 4D case to show the outcomes of the similarity.
`perturbation.py` collects different functions for applying some transformations to molecules (e.g, translation, rotation, ...)
