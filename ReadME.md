# 3D Molecule Similarity with Ultrafast Shape Recognition with Elements (USRE)

This directory contains a collection of scripts, input files, and output files for optimizing molecular geometries and calculating 3D molecular similarities using the USRE (Ultra fast shape recognition with elements) method.

## Files

### Input Files
- `guacamol_v1_all.smiles`: Starting molecules in SMILES format.
- `sample3d.sdf`: Starting 3D molecular structures in SDF format.

### Scripts
- `refiner.py`: Python script to optimize the geometry of input molecules.
- `change_atoms.py`: Python script to modify input molecules by substituting atoms.
- `similarity_3d.py`: Python script containing functions to calculate 3D molecular similarity using the USRE method.
- `example.py`: Example script demonstrating how to use the `similarity_3d.py` functions and test the results.

### Output Files
- `sample3d_optimized.sdf`: Optimized 3D molecular structures generated by `refiner.py`.
- `sample3d_optimized_switched.sdf`: Modified 3D molecular structures generated by `change_atoms.py`.

## How to Use

- Run `refiner.py` to optimize the geometry of the input molecules. This will generate `sample3d_optimized.sdf`.
- Run `change_atoms.py` to modify the optimized molecules. This will generate `sample3d_optimized_switched.sdf`.
- Use the functions in `similarity_3d.py` to calculate the 3D molecular similarity between molecules using the USRE method. You can use `example.py` as a reference for how to call these functions and test the results.

For more detailed instructions and explanations of the individual functions, please refer to the comments within each script file.
