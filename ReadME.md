# 6D Molecular Similarity

This directory hosts the resources for the development of a 6D molecular similarity measure. Ideally, this will serve as the go-to package for those looking to employ such a similarity metric.

## Folder Structure

- **Source**: 
  - Houses the core code for the 6D molecular similarity measure.
  
- **Tests**: 
  - Consists of unit tests ensuring the proper functionality of the measure.

- **Trials**: 
  - A collection of miscellaneous scripts. For instance:
    - `example.py` demonstrates how to utilize the similarity measure and its associated functions.
    - There are visualization scripts for both 3D and 4D cases, showcasing the results of the similarity metric.
    - `perturbation.py` aggregates various functions to apply transformations to molecules, such as translation, rotation, and more.
